        "#### What BurnMan does and doesn't do\n",
        "\n",
        "Members of the BurnMan Team are often asked whether BurnMan does Gibbs energy minimization. The short answer to that is no, for three reasons:\n",
        "1) Python is ill-suited to such computationally intensive problems. \n",
        "2) There are many pieces of software already in the community that do Gibbs energy minimization, including but not limited to: PerpleX, HeFESTo, Theriak Domino, MELTS, ENKI, FactSAGE (proprietary), and MMA-EoS.\n",
        "3) Gibbs minimization is a hard problem. The brute-force pseudocompound/simplex technique employed by Perple_X is the only globally robust method, but clever techniques have to be used to make the computations tractable, and the solution found is generally only a (very close) approximation to the true minimum assemblage. More refined Newton / higher order schemes (e.g. HeFESTo, MELTS, ENKI) provide an exact solution, but can get stuck in local minima or even fail to find a solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, with those things in mind, what *does* BurnMan do? Well, because BurnMan can compute the Gibbs energy and analytical derivatives of composite materials, it is well suited to solving the equilibrium relations for *fixed assemblages*. This is done using the `burnman.equilibrate` function, which acts in a similar (but slightly more general) way to the THERMOCALC software developed by Tim Holland, Roger Powell and coworkers. Essentially, one chooses an assemblage (e.g. olivine + garnet + orthopyroxene) and some equality constraints (typically related to bulk composition, pressure, temperature, entropy, volume, phase proportions or phase compositions) and the `equilibrate` function attempts to find the remaining unknowns that satisfy those constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a sense, then, the `equilibrate` function is simultaneously more powerful and more limited than Gibbs minimization techniques. It allows the user to investigate and plot metastable reactions, and quickly obtain answers to questions like \"at what pressure does wadsleyite first become stable along a given isentrope?\". However, it is not designed to create P-T tables of equilibrium assemblages. If a user wishes to do this for a complex problem, we refer them to other existing codes. BurnMan also contains a useful utility material called `burnman.PerplexMaterial` that is specifically designed to read in and interrogate P-T data from PerpleX. \n",
        "\n",
        "There are a couple more caveats to bear in mind. Firstly, the `equilibrate` function is experimental and can certainly be improved. Equilibrium problems are highly nonlinear, and sometimes solvers struggle to find a solution. If you have a better, more robust way of solving these problems, we would *love* to hear from you! Secondly, the `equilibrate` function is not completely free from the curse of multiple roots - sometimes there is more than one solution to the equilibrium problem, and BurnMan (and indeed any equilibrium software) may find one a metastable root."

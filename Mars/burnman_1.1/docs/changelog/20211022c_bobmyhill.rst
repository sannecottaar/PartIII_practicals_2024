* A new equation of state, BroshCalphad has been implemented,
  as described in :cite:`Brosh2007`. This new equation of state is used to
  define the properties of the BCC, FCC, HCP and liquid polymorphs of iron,
  as parameterised by :cite:`SE2015`. These endmembers can be initialised from
  the BurnMan mineral database (:class:`~burnman.minerals.SE_2015.bcc_iron`,
  :class:`~burnman.minerals.SE_2015.fcc_iron`,
  :class:`~burnman.minerals.SE_2015.hcp_iron`
  and :class:`~burnman.minerals.SE_2015.liquid_iron`).

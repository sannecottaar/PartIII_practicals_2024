BurnMan |version|: a thermodynamic and geophysics toolkit for the Earth and planetary sciences
===============================================================================================


.. image:: burnjack-bar.png

BurnMan is a Python library for computing the thermodynamic and thermoelastic properties
of geological materials from simple mineral endmembers to complex multilayered planetary interiors.

BurnMan is released under the GNU GPL v2 or newer. It relies heavily on numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.

If you haven't yet installed BurnMan, you can go straight to :ref:`ref-installation` for detailed
instructions. After that, you might want to try out :ref:`ref-example-tutorial` or the other
:ref:`ref-examples`. Finally, and most importantly, have fun!

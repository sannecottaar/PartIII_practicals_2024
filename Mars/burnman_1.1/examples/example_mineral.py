example_mineral
---------------

This example shows how to create mineral objects in BurnMan,
and how to output their thermodynamic and thermoelastic quantities.

Mineral objects are the building blocks for more complex objects in BurnMan.
These objects are intended to represent minerals (or melts, or fluids)
of fixed composition, with a well defined equation of state that defines
the relationship between the current state (pressure and temperature) of
the mineral and its thermodynamic potentials and derivatives
(such as volume and entropy).

Mineral objects are initialized with a dictionary containing all of the
parameters required by the desired equation of state. BurnMan contains
implementations of may equations of state (:doc:`eos`).


*Uses:*

* :doc:`mineral_database`
* :class:`burnman.Mineral`


*Demonstrates:*

* Different ways to define an endmember
* How to set state
* How to output thermodynamic and thermoelastic properties

    In petrology, we are often interested in phases for which we have little
    experimental or theoretical information.
    One common example is when we want to approximate the properties
    of an ordered phase relative to its disordered counterparts.
    In many cases, a reasonable procedure is to make a mechanical mixture
    of the known phases, such that they are the correct composition of
    the unknown phase, and then apply a linear correction to the Gibbs
    energy of the phase (i.e. Delta G = Delta E - T Delta S + P Delta V).
    In BurnMan, we do this using the CombinedMineral class.
    In the lines below, we create an ordered orthopyroxene with composition
    MgFeSi2O6 from a 50:50 mixture of enstatite and ferrosilite.

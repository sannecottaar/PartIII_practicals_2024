* The ideal solution model has been updated to allow site multiplicities to
  vary linearly with endmember proportions. It therefore implements a
  Temkin-type model :cite:`Temkin1945`.

* As a result of the changes to the ideal model, the site_multiplicities
  attribute of a solid solution is now a 2D array.

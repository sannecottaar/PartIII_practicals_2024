## Companion code to
# An anisotropic equation of state for high pressure, high temperature applications
## R. Myhill

The python scripts contained in this directory accompany the paper
published by Myhill (2021; https://doi.org/10.31223/X5561D).
There are comments in each of the scripts, so it is hoped that by reading
these in tandem with the original paper, the reader will get a feel
for how to use the code for their own purposes.

The scripts contained in this directory are as follows:

cubic_fitting.py
----------------
Creates an AnisotropicMineral object corresponding to periclase.

orthorhombic_fitting.py
------------------------
Creates an AnisotropicMineral object corresponding to San Carlos olivine.

There is also a data directory that contains the data used to fit the
model parameters.

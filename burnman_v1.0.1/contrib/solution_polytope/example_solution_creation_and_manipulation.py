example_solution_creation_and_manipulation
----------------

This example script demonstrates how the site-occupancy space of
a solid solution is mathematically equivalent to a polytope, and how
this insight can be used to semi-automate the creation and
manipulation of solution models.

*Uses:*

* :class:`burnman.MaterialPolytope`
* :func:`burnman.tools.math.generate_complete_basis`
* :func:`burnman.tools.polytope.solution_polytope_from_charge_balance`
* :func:`burnman.tools.polytope.solution_polytope_from_endmember_occupancies`
* :func:`burnman.tools.solution.transform_solution_to_new_basis`
* :func:`burnman.tools.chemistry.site_occupancies_to_strings`
* :doc:`mineral_database`


*Demonstrates:*

* Generation of several different polytopes from charge balance constraints
* Interrogation of solution polytopes for endmember site distributions
* Generation of independent endmember sets from polytopes
* Completion of an independent endmember set from a partial set
* Transformation of endmember basis sets

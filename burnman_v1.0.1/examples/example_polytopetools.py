example_tools.polytope
---------------------

This example script demonstrates how to use the linear algebra functions
included in the tools.polytope module. In particular, it shows how a
user can automatically calculate the endmembers bounding a solution or a
composite polytope.

*Uses:*

* :class:`burnman.polytope.MaterialPolytope`
* :func:`burnman.polytope.generate_complete_basis`
* :func:`burnman.tools.polytope.solution_polytope_from_charge_balance`
* :func:`burnman.tools.polytope.solution_polytope_from_endmember_occupancies`
* :func:`burnman.tools.chemistry.site_occupancies_to_strings`
* :func:`burnman.tools.polytope.composite_polytope_at_constrained_composition`
* :func:`burnman.tools.polytope.simplify_composite_with_composition`
* :doc:`mineral_database`


*Demonstrates:*

* Generation of several different polytopes from charge balance constraints
* Interrogation of solution polytopes for endmember site distributions
* Generation of independent endmember sets from polytopes
* Completion of an independent endmember set from a partial set
* Simplifying composites at a given bulk composition

    Part 1: Solution models

    First, we show how to generate a polytope from a set of species charges
    and total charge. The function we use here is
    solution_polytope_from_charge_balance.

    One attribute of the returned MaterialPolytope instance is
    endmember_occupancies, which is a 2D numpy array of the
    site-species occupancies of each endmember.

    The function site_occupancies_to_strings converts the array into a
    list of strings corresponding to the endmember formulae.

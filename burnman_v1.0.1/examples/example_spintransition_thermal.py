example_spintransition_thermal
------------------------------

This example illustrates how to create a non-ideal solid solution model
for (Mg,Fe\ :sup:`HS`\ ,Fe\ :sup:`LS`\ )O ferropericlase that has a gradual
spin transition at finite temperature.
First, we define the MgO endmember and two endmembers for the low and high spin
states of FeO. Then we create a regular/symmetric solid solution that
incorporates all three endmembers. The modified solid solution class
contains a method called set_equilibrium_composition, which calculates
the equilibrium proportions of the low and high spin phases at the
desired bulk composition, pressure and temperature.

In this example, we neglect the elastic component of mixing. We
also implicitly apply the Bragg-Williams approximation (i.e., we assume
that there is no short-range order by only incorporating interactions that are
a function of the average occupancy of species on each distinct site).
Furthermore, the one site model [Mg,Fe\ :sup:`HS`\ ,Fe\ :sup:`LS`\ ]O
explicitly precludes long range order.

*Specifically uses:*

* :func:`burnman.Mineral`
* :func:`burnman.SolidSolution`

*Demonstrates:*

* implementation of gradual spin transition in (Mg,Fe)O at a user-defined
  pressure and temperature
